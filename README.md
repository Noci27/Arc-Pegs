## A web-based and open-source physics game
This is a physics based ball game where your goal is to hit all of the pegs with a limited numer of balls, very similar to the game "Peggle". This game is still in early developement, currently being in version 0.3, so there's a lot missing and it's quite buggy. Updates can take a while to be released since this is just a hobby and time is very limited. 
## Context and motivation behind Arc Pegs
I started making this little game after watching a video about Peggle and thinking "Hey, I could do that!". As an added challenge for myself, I've banned the use external libraries, so I really have to create everything myself. Turns out, programming physics, even something as simple as a bouncing ball, is quite difficult to make from the ground up. I'm still motivated to finish this and add all of the ideas I have in mind, it might just take a while!

These issues will hopefully be fixed in the future.
## To-Do List
Here's a list of things which I intend to add:
- Shooting mechanic
- Different kinds of pegs (mainly round ones)
- Functionality for pegs to actually disappear
- Score counter
- Sound effects
- Premade Levels + seperate level editor
- Menus
- Visual overhaul (will be done last)

There is no particular order in which these will be done.
